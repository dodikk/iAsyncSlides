objective-c nested asynchronous blocks



http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13309686/how-to-do-structured-programming-using-blocks-in-objective-c
When using methods which return blocks they can be very convenient. However, when you have to string a few of them together it gets messy really quickly

for instance, you have to call 4 URLs in succession:

[remoteAPIWithURL:url1 success:^(int status){
    [remoteAPIWithURL:url2 success:^(int status){
        [remoteAPIWithURL:url3 success:^(int status){
            [remoteAPIWithURL:url2 success:^(int status){
            //succes!!!
            }];
        }];
    }];
}];

I'm using AFNetworking for asynchronous calls to a web service. Some of these calls must be chained together, where the results of call A are used by call B which are used by call C, etc.
AFNetworking handles results of async calls with success/failure blocks set at the time the operation is created:


It was not uncommon when using AFNetworking in Gowalla to have calls chained together in success blocks.
My advice would be to factor the network requests and serializations as best you can into class methods in your model. Then, for requests that need to make sub-requets, you can call those methods in the success block.
